## Getting started with rtweet

Install from CRAN using `install.packages`.

```{r}
## install from CRAN
install.packages("rtweet")
```

Alternatively, install the most recent [development] version from
Github using `install_github` (from the devtools package).

```{r}
## install from Github (dev version)
if (!"devtools" %in% installed.packages()) {
    install.packages("devtools")
}
devtools::install_github("mkearney/rtweet")
```

I've tried to make the API token [oauth] process as painless as
possible. In fact, rtweet even comes with a built-in token, so
users can start collecting Twitter data in seconds.

```{r}
library(rtweet)
ica17 <- search_tweets("ICA17 OR ICA2017", n = 1000)
ts_plot(ica17, "hours") +
    ggplot2::labs(
        x = "Date and time of tweets",
        y = "Frequency of tweets",
        title = "Time series of #ICA17 tweets",
        subtitle = "Frequency of Twitter statuses calculated in one-hour intervals."
    ) +
    ggplot2::ggsave(file.path("..", "docs", "img", "ica17tweets.png"),
                    device = "png",
                    width = 7, height = 5, units = "in")
```

The built-in token is token is only meant to be used for test
drives. There's no guarantee it will work as expected. Instead, users
should create their own Twitter API tokens. For step-by-step
instructions on how to create and manage your Twitter API token, see
the ["auth" vignette](https://mkearney.github.io/rtweet/articles/auth.html).
The vignette also includes instructions for saving your token as an
environment variable. This allows your token to be read into the R
environment automatically in future sessions.
